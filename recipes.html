        <h3>A little history on Syllabub...</h3>
        <p>Syllabub was originally a simple drink of sweet wine and frothed cream popularized in the early 16th century. The cream would usually separate from the wine and rise to the top (similar in appearance to that of a root beer float). However, the centuries went on, much more sugar was added to syllabub in order to stabilize it and cause the cream and wine to stay together - thus creating <em>everlasting</em> syllabub.</p>

        <p>Everlasting syllabub was then even further perfected by famous English victorian cook, Hannah Glasse who at her age was a sort of Julia Childs (and was also known worldwide despite living in the 1700s all the way from the American colonies to India). This everlasting syllabub is her method made airy and sweet. Enjoy!</p>
